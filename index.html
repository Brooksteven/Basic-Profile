        <p>I’m a web developer living in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for food, food, and more food. I'm particularly interested in working with food by creating alkaline meal plans to bring healing to the body.</p>
        <p>I am in the process of receiving a Fullstack Web Developer Certification from Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp, and I have a Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Biology from Georgia State University.</p>
        <p>I have experience with html5, css3, and JavaScript. More recently, I've been working with JQuery and Nodejs.</p>
        <p>I currently work at Trader Joe’s and I get the opportunity to help customers find and create delicious meals.</p>
        <p>I spend majority of my free time coding, hanging out with my fiancé, going out to try new food, actively looking for a house, and working with my fiancé to plan our wedding.</p>
        <p>I am interested in learning about new opportunities and can be reached through this profile or by email: <a href="mailto:brooksteven54@gmail.com" target="_blank">brooksteven54@gmail.com</a></p>
